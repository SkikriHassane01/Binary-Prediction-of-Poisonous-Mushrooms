In this project, we tackle a classic machine learning challenge: predicting whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its physical characteristics. This task is part of the 2024 Kaggle Playground Series, designed to help participants practice and refine their machine learning skills with approachable yet intriguing datasets.

## Project Objective:

The primary goal is to classify mushrooms into two categories:

- Edible (e)
- Poisonous (p)

## Data Description:

The dataset includes a mix of features that describe the mushrooms' physical characteristics. These features were generated from a deep learning model trained on the well-known UCI Mushroom dataset. While the feature distributions are similar to the original dataset, there are differences that add complexity to the challenge.
